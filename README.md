Shop.js is a front-end framework for ecommerce powered by [Hanzo][hanzo]. It has
a fully customizable look and feel with many built-in reactive components.

## Examples
You can see a great example of Shop.js in action at
[stoned.audio](https://stoned.audio). It powers the complete shopping experience
from their referral program and user signup to checkout and customer
portal.

## Containers and Controls
Containers are Custom HTML tags that define a section of embeddable dynamic content.
Controls are very simple composeable widgets that provide ui inputs and outputs
for users.  Containers can contain other containers or controls.

Containers also expose data fields from the global data
[referrential tree](https://github.com/zeekay/referential) passed into
Shop.start and services.  Data fields are accessed using the 'data' special
variable (see below) and services which are accessed by their name.  Services
are either functions or read-only fields.

For example a submit() service can be invoked by calling 'submit()' directly or
binding an event 'onclick="submit"' for invokation by user when they interact
with an element on the page.

## Special Variables

### data
A reference to the global data referrential tree.
that's passed into the Shop.start function can be referenced from most
containers by using the 'data' variable.

The exceptions to this rule are lineitem and order which are used internally by
the looping containers lineitems and orders respectively.  The 'data' in these containers refer
to the specific item that's currently being looped over.  For example a lineitems container loops over order.items, a lineitem container's
'data' variable refers to the specific item being looped over.

### parent-data

Both lineitem and order both have a 'parent-data' variable that refer to their
immediate parents's for composeability reasons, namely to get fields like
'currency' relatively from the parent order or user.

### parent
The 'parent' variable references the parent container of the current container.
It is useful for using data fields or invoking services of a parent container.
Be aware that the root container has no parent set.

### lineitems
The lineitems container loops over and displays an order's or cart's line items (usually the order.items field).
The lineitems must be used inside of either a cart or orders container.
Internally, a lineitems container simply wraps a lineitem container in a loop.

Template data inside of a lineitems container's HTML tags are passed onto
each lineitem container and will be transcluded in lineitem.

It is best to use this container inside another container instead of at the top
level so it can be rendered along side other order information.

###### Data Fields
n/a

###### Services
n/a

### lineitem
The lineitem container exposes an item and records quantity data. It is not used
directly in most cases. It should be used implicitly as part of the lineitems
container instead. When using lineitem containers directly, parentData (via parent-data
attribute, e.g. <lineitem parent-data="{ data.get('order') }" /> ) must be set to the order data.
